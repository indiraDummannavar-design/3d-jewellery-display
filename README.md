# 3D Jewellery Display – Interactive Ring Showcase  
### CEVI Internship Technical Assessment  
Built with **A-Frame**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**

This project is a fully interactive **3D jewellery display system** designed for showcasing premium rings in a virtual environment.  
Users can click on a ring to bring it forward, inspect it through **automatic 360° rotation**, and close the view using a dedicated button.  
All interaction logic has been implemented manually without using pre-built A-Frame interaction libraries.
